        <p>AptRock327, 13, he was born [month] [day] 2007, he seemed really interested in computers played a lot of video games, when he got his first mobile phone, he downloaded a game maker familiar to scratch when he was 7, he was more and more interested in computers totally leaving behind anything else and knew he wanted to be a programmer. When he was 10 a school bonus activity lesson appeared that was teaching the programming language known as Python, later he got into C++ and C. When AptRock327 was almost 12 he started his game development using unity, he played around with it just a bit (around 3 months), but that's how he learned a lot of C#. AptRock327 got again interested in unity when he was almost 13, he still tries to make his skills better. Right now, for a couple months he was doing more of C++ and python, wrote an interpreter, and now he is writing his own operating system.</p>
